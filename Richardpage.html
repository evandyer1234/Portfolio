		Richard, The Game was a little 2D platformer where the player would encounter things that would normally be seen as hazards, but in reality would be power-ups. Such as an electric field that would electrically charge Richard and give him a ranged electric attack. Or a pool of lava that would allow him to wipe the screen of enemies with a heat wave. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Even without those, Richard has some interesting mechanics to him. To start he can do some simple moves like jumping and attacking infont of him. He can do a mid-air spin to get a bit of extra height and attack enemies all around him. He can do a charging spin attack to attack infront of him and clear larger gaps. has can also do the same attack downward to break through blocks below him and bash enemies.
