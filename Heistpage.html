			Heist of the Mirror Emporium is a VR stealth game where the player must traverse a shipping center guarded by robots. Getting caught means starting over. The player eventually finds tiny shields that they can throw at the robots to destroy them.
			Mirrors are also littered about so that the player can look around corners without being spotted.
			<br>
			<br>
			It starts off with the player entering the front door into the starting area where they meet their first robot and see their first mirror. They then go into an air vent section and drop into the next area. There they must use the shields to destroy the robots to advance. The final area has the player walk through a wall where reality is destroyed. There they must find a cube. After realizing they can only see the cube in the mirror and picking it up, there is a bit of dialogue and the game ends.
