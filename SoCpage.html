		Spark of chaos was a short, solo Game Jam project, that went thorugh a few iterations afterward. It is a twin stick shooter where the player muat survev as long as they can, racking up points by killing enemies and destroying "Order Generators". Each generator destroyed adds a randomly generated line of text, showing what chaos the player has introduced into the world.
		<br>
		<br>
		The Jam's theme was RNG. The randomness of this game comes from an affect that randomly changes whenever the player reloads their guns. Each gun has a random number attached to it, the twi numbers added together is the chosen effect of the bullets on hit. The higher the number, the better the effect.
