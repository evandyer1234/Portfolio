		Tug Tug is a game in which the player must navigate bubble to a swirly thing. The catch is that the player cannot directly control bubble. Instead the player must use various tug points located around the level to pull bubble in that direction.

			Tug Tug was originally done souley with Glint, and a fair amount of progress was made with that. I decided to remake the project in Unity 2D part way through so that I would be able to have graphics and not jump through a lot of unnecessary hoops like not being able to see the level outside the game view and no lines rendering in builds. Having a project that I can actually give to people to play is rather important to me. I also progammed my own phyics for this game.
