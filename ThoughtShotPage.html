			Thought Shot was a game jam project for a XR game jam. I had a week to make it instead of the usual weekend and free assets were allowed, I also servered as the project manager for a team of students from different colleges all over the U.S. The Project also won Best Overall Game as well as tied for best soundtrack.

			The game is a VR twin stick style shooter, where the player can make a thought bubble and pull weapons out of it. The weapons include pistols, grenades, and a boombox that makes the enemies run away. The game ends in a boss fight against a giant enemy where the player must shoot targets to lower the boss' shields.
