		Richard, The Game was a little 2D platformer where the player would encounter things that would normally be seen as hazards, but in reality would be power-ups. Such as an electric field that would electrically charge Richard and give him a ranged electric attack. Or a pool of lava that would allow him to wipe the screen of enemies with a heat wave.
