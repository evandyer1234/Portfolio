			Heist of the Mirror Emporium is a VR stealth game where the player must traverse a shipping center gaurded by robots. Getting caught means starting over. The player eventually finds tiny shields that they can throw at the robots to destroy them.
			Mirrors are also littered about so that the player can look around corners without being spotted.
			<br>
			<br>
			It starts off with the player entering the front door into the starting area where they meet their first robot and see their first mirror. They then go into an airvent section and dropping into the next area. There they must use the shields to destroy the robots to advance. The final area has the player walk through a wall where reality is destroyed. There they must find a cube. After realizing they can only see the cube in the mirror and picking it up, there is a bit of dialouge and the game ends.

		Richard, The Game was a little 2D platformer where the player would encounter things that would normally be seen as hazards, but in reality would be power-ups. Such as an electric field that would electrically charge Richard and give him a ranged electric attack. Or a pool of lava that would allow him to wipe the screen of enemies with a heat wave. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Even without those, Richard has some interesting mechanics to him. To start he can do some simple moves like jumping and attacking infont of him. He can do a mid-air spin to get a bit of extra height and attack enemies all around him. He can do a charging spin attack to attack infront of him and clear larger gaps. has can also do the same attack downward to break through blocks below him and bash enemies.
