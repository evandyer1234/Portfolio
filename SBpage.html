			Stage Builder is pretty self descriptive. I made a tool for the player to design levels and then play them. There was a small assortment of objects to place and the whole level would be able to be saved and loaded. I also used it as a way to test out a more dynamic camera as the game is a 3D platformer. This game was a continuation of a research project where I learned how to make a save system.
